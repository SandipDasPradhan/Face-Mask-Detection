# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Opencv-and-Python
This paper presents a simplified approach to achieve this purpose using some basic Machine Learning packages like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV and Scikit-Learn. The proposed method detects the face from the image correctly and then identifies if it has a mask on it or not. As a surveillance task performer, it can also detect a face along with a mask in motion. The method attains accuracy up to 95.77% and 94.58% respectively on two different datasets
